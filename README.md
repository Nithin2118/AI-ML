# 📰 FAKE News Detection
A machine learning project aimed at detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This model classifies news articles as either *real* or *fake*, helping to combat misinformation in digital media.

## 📌 Project Overview
With the exponential growth of digital news, the spread of fake or misleading content has become a serious issue. This project uses NLP and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify fake news articles based on their text content.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing using NLP techniques
- TF-IDF vectorization of news content
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation
- Predicts whether a news article is real or fake
- Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction (if applicable)

  ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Streamlit (for frontend, if implemented)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
